> [8.5.0]
>
> - Added `device_config put` for `interaction_jank_monitor` and `latency_tracker` in `service.sh` to reduce background sampling overhead.
> - Added 13 missing global settings keys to the `settings delete` list in `uninstall.sh` (`sf_touch_timer_milliseconds`, `animator_duration_scale`, `force_hw_ui`, `fancy_ime_animations`, `tether_offload_disabled`, `enable_freeform_support`, `enable_non_resizable_multi_window`, `force_resizable_activities`, `development_enable_freeform_windows_support`, `background_activity_starts_enabled`, `hidden_api_policy`, `hidden_api_policy_pre_p_apps`, `hidden_api_policy_p_apps`) that were set by `service.sh` but never cleaned up on uninstall.
> - Added `min_refresh_rate`, `peak_refresh_rate`, `show_touches`, and `pointer_location` to the `settings delete system` list in `uninstall.sh` that were set by `service.sh` but never cleaned up on uninstall.
> - Added `settings delete global display_refresh_rate_in_zone` to `uninstall.sh` that was set by `service.sh` but never cleaned up on uninstall.
> - Added 10 missing `device_config` keys to the delete list in `uninstall.sh` (`runtime_native_boot disable_lock_profiling`, `runtime_native_boot iorap_readahead_enable`, `activity_manager data_sync_fgs_timeout_duration`, `activity_manager fgs_start_allowed_log_sample_rate`, `activity_manager fgs_start_denied_log_sample_rate`, `activity_manager max_cached_processes`, `activity_manager max_empty_time_millis`, `activity_manager max_phantom_processes`, `activity_manager media_processing_fgs_timeout_duration`, `activity_manager_native_boot use_freezer`) that were set by `root` but never cleaned up on uninstall.
> - Added `device_config delete` for `interaction_jank_monitor` and `latency_tracker` in `uninstall.sh` to clean up overrides on uninstall.
> - Added dynamic heap sizing in `post-fs-data.sh` based on device RAM from `/proc/meminfo` across four tiers.
> - Added dynamic `dex2oat-threads` in `post-fs-data.sh` based on actual CPU core count, capped at 6.
> - Added `SELF_PID` filter to top CPU deprioritization loop in `action.sh` to prevent the script from killing itself.
> - Added `dev.axora.manager` to root manager detection in `customize.sh`.
> - Added `$AXERON != "true"` guard at the top of `customize.sh` to abort installation if not run through Axeron/AxManager, before `ID` is even defined.
> - Added `tr -d '\r'` to module ID and name extraction in `verify.sh` to strip CRLF line endings.
> - Added `sha512`, `sha384`, `sha256`, and `sha224` to the hash algorithm fallback list in `verify.sh`; previously only `md5` and `sha1` were supported.
> - Changed `banner=` in `module.prop` from local asset path to remote GitHub URL.
> - Changed banner module for shell/non-root.
> - Changed `strings` grep pattern in `customize.sh` from `manager|pure` to `axora|pure|manager`.
> - Changed `customize.sh` to merge `get_app_label()` into `check_axeron_requirement()` using a `for entry in "pkg:label"` loop; `aapt` is no longer used for root manager label detection.
> - Changed `customize.sh` to remove `AXMPATH` and `AXMPROP` variables in favor of the literal `$AXERONDIR/plugins/$ID` path.
> - Changed `customize.sh` to remove `IS_ROOTED` and `CURRENT_USER` variables in favor of direct `$USER = "root"` checks.
> - Changed `customize.sh` to always re-detect the root manager and overwrite `.method` instead of reading a cached value.
> - Changed `.method` line 3 in `customize.sh` to store `$AXERONVER` instead of the root manager app's versionCode.
> - Changed `set_permissions()` in `customize.sh` to use `find -print0 | while read -d ''` instead of `for path in $(find ...)` for safer handling of filenames with spaces.
> - Changed `top` output in `action.sh` to store in variable first with fallback to `top -n 1` for devices that do not support `-b` flag.
> - Changed `post-fs-data.sh` to always set atrace and Skia tracing properties regardless of whether they existed before.
> - Changed `heaptargetutilization` in `post-fs-data.sh` from `0.5` to `0.75` to avoid excessive GC.
> - Changed `grep -oP` in `service.sh` to `awk` for process name parsing; `-P` flag is not supported by toybox grep.
> - Changed `[ -n "$BIN_FILE" ]` to `[ -x "$BIN_FILE" ]` in `service.sh` to also verify the binary is executable before running.
> - Changed Dalvik VM backup in `post-fs-data.sh` to only save properties that have a value; properties absent before installation are deleted on uninstall without a sentinel.
> - Changed `uninstall.sh` Dalvik restore to delete properties not found in backup instead of reading a sentinel value.
> - Changed `root` sub-comments from `#0–#12` to `#1–#15` with more descriptive labels; split former `#8` into three separate numbered sections.
> - Fixed `printk` backup in `root` separated from kernel param loop; value normalized from tab-separated to space-separated for consistency with restore.
> - Fixed kernel parameter backup in `root` to skip entries with empty values, preventing blank lines in the backup file.
> - Fixed PID validation in `uninstall.sh` to prevent `kill -9` from running without arguments if PID file is empty.
> - Fixed `nohup am start` placed inside `while` loop in `customize.sh`; moved outside so Telegram is opened only once.
> - Fixed device name substitution in `customize.sh` to skip `name=` update if `$DEVICE_NAME` is empty, preventing `name=Kang for` with trailing space.
> - Fixed `check_axeron_requirement()` in `customize.sh` to `return 1` and abort installation if neither `AxManager` nor `Axora` is detected, instead of silently continuing with an empty `.method` file.
> - Fixed vmstat variables in `action.sh` — `cache`, `so`, and `free` now default to `0` if vmstat output is empty or unavailable.
> - Fixed `sleep 1` added after `am force-stop` in `action.sh` to allow processes to fully terminate before `pidof`.
> - Fixed division by zero in `service.sh` when `/proc/meminfo` is unavailable; `MEM_TOTAL` and `MEM_AVAIL` now default to safe values.
> - Fixed stale runtime `description=` text in `service.sh` that overwrote `module.prop` on every boot with outdated wording; now matches the current description and uses `|` instead of `•` as separator.
> - Fixed several `cmd`/`dumpsys`/`settings`/`fstrim` calls in `root` and `shell` that only redirected stderr; changed to redirect both stdout and stderr so system service error/status messages no longer leak to the log.
> - Removed `.method` file deletion from `uninstall.sh`; only the plugin directory is removed on uninstall.
> - Removed `$LOGNAME` check in `service.sh` user detection; `$USER` alone is now used.
> - Removed duplicate SurfaceFlinger property deletion block in `uninstall.sh`; already covered by the debug property reset loop.
> - Removed `assets/KANG01.jpg` and `assets/KANG02.jpg` from ZIP extraction in `customize.sh`.
> - Removed `get_app_label()` function from `customize.sh`; `aapt` is no longer used.
> - Removed minimum `$AXERONVER` (14000) version requirement check from `customize.sh`.
> - Removed `.sha`/`.md5` hash file cleanup step from `customize.sh`.
> - Removed `zip=$(clean_path "$zip")` sanitization in `extract()` in `verify.sh`; zip path is no longer cleaned before use.
> - Removed `tune2fs` journal optimization from `action.sh`.
> - Removed CPU core count cap of 8 in `post-fs-data.sh` to support devices with more than 8 cores.
